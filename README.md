# Data Science for Fundraising

## Project Overview

**Data Science for Fundraising** is a project that explores how data science techniques can be applied to fundraising efforts. The project is based entirely on publicly available data and aims to provide actionable insights for improving fundraising strategies.

This repository draws inspiration from a variety of foundational texts that have influenced the approach and techniques applied throughout the project:

- *Data Science for Fundraising* by Anna Maria Sciaccotta
- *Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline* by Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt
- *Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking* by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett
- *Making the Ask: The Artful Science of High-Value Fundraising* by Bernard Ross
- *Leading with AI and Analytics: Build Your Data Science IQ to Drive Business Value* by Eric Anderson and David Stodder
- *7-Figure Fundraising: A Guide to Help You Raise Millions to Change the World* by Trevor Bragdon
- *Fundraising Analytics: Using Data to Guide Strategy* by Joshua M. Birkholz

The project involves applying various data science techniques such as exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling to gain insights and optimize fundraising strategies for organizations.

## Goals

- Explore publicly available datasets to develop data-driven fundraising strategies.
- Analyze historical data to predict donor behavior and optimize campaign targeting.
- Apply machine learning techniques to segment donors and maximize fundraising efforts.
